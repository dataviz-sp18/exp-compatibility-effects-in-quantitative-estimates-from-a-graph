# Exploring Compatibility Effects in Quantitative Estimates from a Line Graph

The present experiment explores the potential influence of a vertical compatibility effect on quantitative judgements and whether this effect, if present, is attenuated by gridlines. No effect of compatibility was found. However, an effect of direction was found: quantitative estimates of change appear to be more error-prone for decreases.
